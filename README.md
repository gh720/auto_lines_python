# Automatic lines player

The purpose of this project is to build an automatic player for "Color Lines" game.
So far the project is in the "exploration" mode. 
A lot of various heuristics implemented to improve the quality of decision taking.
But it still loses at some point :)

Whether it is possible to keep from losing remains to be seen.

### Running

If curious, you can try to run it with `python al_graph.py -a 0`.
